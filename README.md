# awful-winter-jam-2018

Was going to be a game for the [2018 Winter Awful Jam](http://www.awfuljams.com/), but some stuff happened those exact weeks that prevented me from doing anything substantial. At most, includes a simplified version of my roguelike architecture from [https://github.com/RolandMQuiros/Lost-Generation](Lost Generation).
