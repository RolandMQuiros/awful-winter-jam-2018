Player has five or so resources, called Belief, to purchase Pawns.
You have a limited number of "Eras" on each Board. An Era is 10 Board steps.
Moving forward in the timeline, all the Pawns on the board act autonomously.

Your goal is to create a society that yields certain balances of Belief, given the number of Eras, 

Every cell has Health
